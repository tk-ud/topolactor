# Core Rule: Architecture Subject

Read this rule when work touches architecture explanation, runtime ownership, DTO/entity boundaries, DB topology, frontend projection, or explicit-failure behavior.

## Rules

- Data-defined topology is the architecture subject. Not DTOs, not CRUD, not layered MVC.
- OperationVector is internal runtime representation. It is not the architecture subject.
- DTO is endpoint contract only. DTOs are not the subject of the architecture.
- DB is the semantic topology space. It stores registries, schemas, packages, relations, structure maps, and function parameters.
- Backend is the abstract runtime. It executes functions against stored topology data.
- Frontend is the physical projection space. It projects UI from packages, schemas, and component expansions.
- Broken refs are explicit errors, not silent fallback. Any unresolved reference must return a validation error.
- Real business data is out of scope for the public skeleton.
