# Agent Rules

## Architecture Rules

- Data-defined topology is the architecture subject. Not DTOs, not CRUD, not layered MVC.
- OperationVector is internal runtime representation. It is not the architecture subject.
- DTO is endpoint contract only. DTOs are not the subject of the architecture.
- DB is the semantic topology space. It stores registries, schemas, packages, relations, structure maps, and function parameters.
- Backend is the abstract runtime. It executes functions against stored topology data.
- Frontend is the physical projection space. It projects UI from packages, schemas, and component expansions.
- Broken refs are explicit errors, not silent fallback. Any unresolved reference must return a validation error.
- Real business data is out of scope for the public skeleton.
- Structure check must pass before completion report.

## Runtime Policy / Magic Number Rules

Runtime behavior must be data-defined whenever the value can change by topology, hub, domain, role, operation, package, schema, deployment, or projection context.

Do not hide runtime behavior in magic numbers or private constants.

The following value categories must first be considered as Registry / Manifest / function_parameters / structure_map policy / package-schema parameters:

- topology behavior
- recommendation behavior
- selection behavior
- promotion behavior
- validation behavior
- scoring behavior
- threshold behavior
- retention behavior
- routing behavior
- UI projection behavior

Inline values are allowed only when they are not runtime policy:

- loop counters
- local collection limits used only to protect iteration mechanics
- protocol constants
- harmless display-only values
- test fixtures
- deterministic placeholder IDs in skeleton topology

Allowed inline values must stay local and must not become hidden business or runtime policy.

If a value affects Runtime output, candidate ranking, validation result, persistence scope, emission shape, routing, retention, or projection behavior, it must not be introduced as an unexplained constant.

Required decision order:

1. Can this value be stored in an existing Registry / Manifest / function_parameters / structure_map policy surface?
2. Can this value be scoped by hub / relation / domain / role / operation / package / schema?
3. If yes, keep Runtime as executor and resolve the value from stored topology data.
4. If policy storage is not implemented yet, return an explicit missing-policy / missing-parameter status rather than inventing a production fallback.
5. If the value is truly mechanical, document why inline is acceptable.

Production fallback constants are prohibited.

Test fixtures may contain representative policy values, but they must be isolated under tests and must not be referenced by production Runtime or Repository code.

## Local CI Gate

`.agent/tests/*.sh` are local CI gates for agents.

GitHub Actions workflows are audit wrappers for PR verification. They must not be treated as the agent's primary debug loop.

Required local checks:

- Always run `bash .agent/tests/check-structure.sh`.
- For DB or SQL changes, run `bash .agent/tests/check-db-schema.sh`.
- For backend or C# runtime changes, run `bash .agent/tests/check-backend-tests.sh`.
- For frontend or Fresh/Deno/Preact changes, run `bash .agent/tests/check-frontend-types.sh`.

Local CI policy:

- CI red means no commit and no push.
- If local CI is red, fix the error first.
- After fixing, rerun the relevant local CI.
- Only green local CI may proceed to commit and push.
- A missing required tool means the check was not executed, not that it passed.
- Completion reports must distinguish actual passes from environment-limited non-execution.

## Agent Report and Task Surfaces

`.agent/reports/` is for routine, scheduled, or automatically executed agent reports.

`.agent/tasks/todo.md` is for unresolved tasks discovered by routine automation, or residual tasks that must survive beyond the current PR or conversation.

Normal PR work must not use `.agent/reports/` as a summary/log output surface.

Normal PR work must not update `.agent/tasks/todo.md` unless a real remaining task must be carried forward after merge.

When no residual task exists, keep `.agent/tasks/todo.md` present but empty of task items.

## Canonical Runtime Route

```text
stored_topology_data
→ user_operation
→ operation_vector
→ attractor_resolve
→ structure_map_resolve
→ package_resolve
→ schema_resolve
→ component_expand
→ emission_or_projection
```

Do not bypass any step. Do not add silent fallbacks anywhere in this route.

## Agent Behavior

- Read `.agent/docs/required-paths.yaml` to understand required structure.
- Run `.agent/tests/check-structure.sh` before reporting task completion.
- Use `.agent/reports/` only for routine / scheduled / automated agent reports.
- Update `.agent/tasks/todo.md` only for residual tasks that must survive beyond the current PR or conversation.
- Do not convert topolactor to CRUD or MVC.
- Do not add build steps, DB execution, or integration tests under the structure check surface.
